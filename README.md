# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Data-Science
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early detection of heart-related conditions can save countless lives by enabling timely medical intervention. This project leverages Data Science and Machine Learning techniques to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on clinical parameters.
This repository includes a complete workflow—from data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and visualization—to create an accurate heart disease prediction system.
